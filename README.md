This is my small/big project of a d20 System Role Playing Game Tabletop website.

I am writing this website to learn HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP. Ergo, I am a beginner.

Since I started working as a Web Developer, I'm restyling the whole website

## Version Log:

**0.0.1** - Wrote [index.php] login page completely.
