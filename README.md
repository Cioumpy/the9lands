This is my small/big project of a d20 System Role Playing Game Tabletop website.

I am writing this website to learn HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP. Ergo, I am a beginner.

## Version Log:

**0.0.5b** - Applied AJAX to all interactive descriptions.

**0.0.5a** - Started implementing AJAX functions in the menus.

**0.0.5** - Fixed bug about scrolling lists inside the modals.
